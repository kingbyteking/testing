One may argue that we choose most popular business may lead to more competition, should it be a good idea? Yes, as the factors for a successful business is more than we know, so it's just a quick idea to verify. For food, maybe it's a good reference. For other kind of business, good practice should also consider other factors, e.g: population, target client and so forth."
